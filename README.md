# ComFaaS-ML
ComFaaS-ML is a latency-aware serverless scheduler using a compute regressor, Top-K pruner, and listwise/pairwise reranker to pick near-optimal nodes per request. It operates on decision-time features only, avoids label leakage, and scales to large clusters with fast per-request inference.
